# Weighted Arithmetic Water Quality Index (WAWQI)

This project performs an analysis of water quality based on the Weighted Arithmetic Water Quality Index (WAWQI) method.

## 📂 Dataset
- Simulated dataset with parameters such as pH, TDS, salinity, turbidity, etc.
- File: `Simulated_WAWQI_Data_with_Salinity_Temp.csv`

## ⚙️ Features
- Preprocessing of CSV data
- Handling encoding issues and BOM
- Compute WAWQI using standards
- Plot WAWQI values per sample
- Visualize water quality trends

## 📊 Libraries Used
- `pandas`
- `numpy`
- `matplotlib`
- `seaborn`

## 🧮 Formula Used

WAWQI is calculated using:
